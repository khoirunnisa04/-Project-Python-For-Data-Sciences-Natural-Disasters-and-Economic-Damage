## About 
We will process the Natural Disaster and Economic Loss dataset. This data contains information about global natural disasters and the resulting economic losses. The types of natural disasters in question are 'Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Extreme temperature', 'Extreme weather', 'Flood', 'Impact', 'Landslide', 'Mass movement', 'Mountain eruption', and ' Forest fires'.

There are 2 data sets that we combine, namely information from all natural disasters and economic losses from the time period 1900-2018.

The models we will use for processing this data are Linear regression and K-Means Clustering
